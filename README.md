# **The Impact of COVID-19 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**

This project explores global COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics such as death rates, infection rates, and vaccination rates across various countries and continents. By leveraging SQL queries, we analyze and aggregate data to generate meaningful insights into the pandemic's impact on populations worldwide.

## **Project Overview**

This SQL portfolio project is designed to:

- **Analyze COVID-19 Death Statistics**: Explore and compare death counts across different countries and continents to understand the lethality of the virus.
- **Evaluate Infection Rates**: Measure infection rates relative to population size to identify the extent of the virusâ€™s spread in various regions.
- **Assess Vaccination Progress**: Calculate vaccination rates by joining COVID-19 death and vaccination datasets to track global and regional vaccination efforts.
- **Utilize SQL for Data Exploration**: Leverage SQL queries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and views to conduct deep data exploration and facilitate data visualization.

## **Datasets Used**

- **CovidDeaths**: This dataset contains information on total COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population data for different countries and regions. It forms the foundation for understanding infection and death trends across the globe.
- **CovidVaccination**: This dataset includes vaccination records, with data on new vaccinations administered daily in various countries. It is essential for analyzing vaccination coverage.

## **Purpose of This Analysis**

The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public health, economies, and societies. Understanding the scope and trends of the pandemic is essential for:

- **Public Health Planning**: Analyzing infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination coverage to optimize health strategies and resource distribution.
- **Evaluating Pandemic Management**: Examining how different countries and regions handled the crisis, which can help assess the effectiveness of health policies and interventions.
- **Informing Future Preparedness**: Identifying trends and patterns of virus spread can aid in preparing for future pandemics and improving response mechanisms.

By conducting this analysis, governments, healthcare organizations, and researchers can derive valuable insights that inform public health policies, improve vaccination strategies, and better prepare for future health crises.
