# SQL Portfolio Project: COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis

This project focuses on exploring global COVID-19 data, including death rates, infection rates, and vaccination rates across different countries and continents. The project utilizes SQL queries to analyze key metrics, aggregate data, and generate insights into how the pandemic impacted populations around the world.

## Project Overview

This SQL portfolio project aims to:

- Explore **COVID-19 death statistics** across the globe.
- Analyze **infection rates** compared to population size for various countries.
- Calculate **vaccination rates** by joining COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations datasets.
- Create **views** and **CTEs** for further analysis and data visualization.

## Datasets Used

- **CovidDeaths**: Contains data on total COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population for various countries.
- **CovidVaccination**: Contains vaccination data for different countries, including the number of new vaccinations administered on specific dates.

## Why This Analysis is Important

Understanding the global impact of COVID-19 is crucial for public health planning, resource allocation, and policy-making. By analyzing death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents, we can gain insights into:

- How well different regions managed the pandemic.
- The effectiveness of vaccination campaigns in various populations.
- Patterns of infection spread, which can help in future pandemic preparedness.

This analysis helps inform governments, health organizations, and researchers to improve their response to future public health crises.
